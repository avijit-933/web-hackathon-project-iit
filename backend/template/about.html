        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Cosmic Watch</span> was created with a simple but powerful idea:
            to make space data understandable, accessible, and meaningful for everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a technology enthusiast with a strong interest in space science, data analysis,
            and full-stack development. While agencies like NASA track thousands of Near-Earth
            Objects (NEOs) every day, this information often remains complex and difficult for
            the general public to interpret.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cosmic Watch bridges that gap by transforming raw asteroid data into clear insights,
            interactive visualizations, and real-time risk assessments. The platform combines
            modern web technologies with trusted space-agency data to help users explore asteroids,
            monitor close approaches, and understand potential impact risks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Space has always been a source of curiosity and inspiration for humanity, but understanding
            what happens beyond our planet often requires technical knowledge that can feel overwhelming.
            Cosmic Watch was built to remove that barrier by presenting scientifically accurate information
            in a clear, visual, and engaging way that anyone can explore with confidence.
        </p>

        <p>
            This platform is designed with a strong focus on user experience. From clean dashboards
            to interactive data displays, every feature is crafted to help users quickly understand
            asteroid behavior without needing an advanced scientific background. The goal is to turn
            complex datasets into meaningful insights that spark learning rather than confusion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cosmic Watch also emphasizes real-time awareness. By continuously fetching live data from
            reliable space-agency sources, the system ensures that users stay informed about newly
            discovered asteroids and upcoming close-approach events. Timely alerts and risk indicators
            allow users to stay ahead of important developments in our cosmic neighborhood.
        </p>

        <p>
            Security and reliability are key priorities of this project. User authentication, data
            protection, and containerized deployment ensure that the platform remains scalable, secure,
            and dependable as it grows. This makes Cosmic Watch suitable not only for enthusiasts but
            also for academic and research-oriented use cases.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond technology, this project reflects a commitment to scientific awareness and global
            safety. By making asteroid monitoring accessible to students, researchers, and the public,
            Cosmic Watch encourages informed discussions about planetary defense and the importance
            of space research in protecting Earth.
        </p>
